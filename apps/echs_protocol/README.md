# EchsProtocol

Protocol and schema definitions for ECHS. This app is intentionally minimal
and will expand as the wire protocol stabilizes.

## Installation

This package is not published to Hex yet. If you vendor it yourself, add
`echs_protocol` to your dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:echs_protocol, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
